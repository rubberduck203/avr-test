# Dual Targeting gcc/avr-gcc

## Summary

Experiment to see if I can set up a dev environment to build and test against both the gcc and the avr-gcc compiler. 
The goal is to be able to run unit tests locally, and then compile with avr-gcc to upload to the target device.

## Notes
I already had gcc installed via xcode.

> gcc --version
> Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
> Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.42)
> Target: x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0
> Thread model: posix
> /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin

Next [install avr-gcc via homebrew](https://github.com/osx-cross/homebrew-avr).

```bash
brew tap osx-cross/avr
brew install avr-gcc
```

Grab a coffee...
This took about an hour.

Meanwhile...

Verify we can compile with gcc.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int
main (void)
{
  printf ("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

```bash
gcc -Wall hello.c -o hello
```

## Tests

I chose CppUTest at the recommendation of James Greening via his book TDD for Embedded C.
Setup [CppUTest](https://cpputest.github.io/)

```bash 
brew install cpputest
```
