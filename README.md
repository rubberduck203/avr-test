# Dual Targeting gcc/avr-gcc

## Summary

Experiment to see if I can set up a dev environment to build and test against both the gcc and the avr-gcc compiler. 
The goal is to be able to run unit tests locally, and then compile with avr-gcc to upload to the target device.

## Notes
I already had gcc installed via xcode.

> gcc --version
> Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
> Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.42)
> Target: x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0
> Thread model: posix
> /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin

Next [install avr-gcc via homebrew](https://github.com/osx-cross/homebrew-avr).

```bash
brew tap osx-cross/avr
brew install avr-gcc
```

Grab a coffee...
This took about an hour.

> üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/avr-gcc/7.2.0: 1,682 files, 174.9MB, built in 56 minutes 45 seconds

Meanwhile...

Verify we can compile with gcc.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int
main (void)
{
  printf ("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

```bash
gcc -Wall hello.c -o hello
```

## Tests

I chose CppUTest at the recommendation of James Greening via his book TDD for Embedded C.
Setup [CppUTest](https://cpputest.github.io/)

```bash 
brew install cpputest
```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18453742/cpputest-example-doesnt-work

> Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:

After a bit of fussing around, created this command that compiles.

```bash
g++ -I/usr/local/Cellar/cpputest/3.8/include \
   -L/usr/local/Cellar/cpputest/3.8/lib -lCppUTest -lCppUTestExt \
   helloTest.cpp AllTests.cpp 
``` 

And then run the tests with `./a.out`

The trouble was I wasn't properly linking in the CppUTest libary when trying to compile.
Created a makefile in the `test` directory to make compiling repeatable.

```bash
cd test
make
bin/test -c #-c colorizes output
```

Improve make by changing `make test` to build and run tests.

## Compiling for avr target

- Add an `avr` target to make file.

```bash
avr-gcc -Wall -mmcu=atxmega128a1 -Os -g -c LedDriver.c -o bin/LedDriver.o
```

- Add a main program for the avr. This file should do *very* little. Just delegate off.

```c
#include "LedDriver.h"

int main(void)
{
    // Just here to make sure we can link
    // Implementation will come later
    return 0;
}
```

```bash
avr-gcc -Wall -mmcu=atxmega128a1 -g -c Main.c -o bin/Main.o
```

- Add link to `avr` make target.

```bash
avr-gcc -Wall -mmcu=atxmega128a1 -g bin/LedDriver.o bin/Main.o -o bin/demo.elf
```

- Extract hex file from elf to upload
- update Main.c to toggle all lights on and off to verify dfu-programmer works

### Setup dfu-programmer

I'm running on a \*nix machine, so I can't use FLIP to upload to the bootloader on my xplained.

## Upload to target device

Open Source Version of Atmel's Flip/BatchISP Tool for \*nix based systems.
Needed for interfacing with Eval board's USB bootloader.
